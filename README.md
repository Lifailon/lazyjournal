Terminal user interface for `journalctl` (tool for reading logs from [systemd](https://github.com/systemd/systemd)), logs in the file system (including archival, for example, apache or nginx) and docker containers for quick viewing and filtering with fuzzy find and regex support (like `fzf` and `grep`), written in Go with the [awesome-gocui](https://github.com/awesome-gocui/gocui) (fork [gocui](https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui)) library.

This tool is inspired by and with love for [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker) and [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit).

## Roadmap

- [X] Sorting logs by modification date and support archived logs from `/var/log` directory
- [X] Support fuzzy find and regular expression to filter output
- [ ] Backgound color of the found word when filtering
- [ ] Filter for log lists
- [ ] Background checking and updating the log when data changes
- [ ] Syntax coloring for logging output
- [ ] Scrolling interface
- [ ] Mouse support
- [ ] Add a switch to load other logs (for example, `USER_UNIT`) and other log paths in the file system
- [ ] Windows support via PowerShell (events and logs from program files)
- [ ] Podman log support
- [ ] Support remote machines via `ssh` protocol

## Install from source

Go must be installed on the system, for example, for Ubuntu you can use the SnapCraft package manager:

```shell
snap install go --classic
go version
```

Clone the repository, install dependencies from `go.mod` and run the project:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Lifailon/lazyjournal
cd lazyjournal/src
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```

Building the executable file:

```shell
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bin/
bin/lazyjournal
```

### Alternatives

- [Dozzle](https://github.com/amir20/dozzle) - is a small lightweight application with a web based interface to monitor Docker logs. It doesnâ€™t store any log files. It is for live monitoring of your container logs only.

If you like using TUI tools, try [multranslate](https://github.com/Lifailon/multranslate) for translating text in multiple translators simultaneously, with support for translation history and automatic language detection.
